Hangman is a simple word-guessing game where the player must guess a hidden word one letter at a time. The game begins with a word randomly selected from a predefined list, and the player tries to uncover the word by guessing letters within a limited number of attempts.

The Python implementation of Hangman features:

* A randomly selected word from a word list.

* Display of the word with blanks for unguessed letters.

* The player guesses one letter at a time.

* A visual representation of the hangman that progressively appears as wrong guesses are made.

* A limit on the number of incorrect guesses before the game is lost.

* Messages indicating whether the player has won or lost.

* The objective of the game is to guess all the letters of the hidden word before running out of attempts.
